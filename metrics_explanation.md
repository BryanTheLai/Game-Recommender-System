How Precision@K and Recall@K are calculated in the context of your game recommendation evaluation, using a clear example.

**The Setup:**

1.  **Train/Test Split:** You've divided the historical interaction data for each user. Let's focus on one specific user, say `user_id = 123`.
    *   `Train Set (user 123)`: Games user 123 positively interacted with *before* the split point (used to *generate* recommendations). Let's imagine this includes games `{A, B, C}`.
    *   `Test Set (user 123)`: Games user 123 positively interacted with *after* the split point (used to *evaluate* recommendations). These are the **"Relevant Items"** or the **ground truth** for this user. Let's imagine this is the set:
        `Actual Relevant Items = {Game X (app_id=100), Game Y (app_id=250), Game Z (app_id=500)}`
        (So, the total number of relevant items for user 123 is **3**).
2.  **Generate Recommendations:** Your system (e.g., CF model) takes User 123's *training* interactions `{A, B, C}` and generates a ranked list of recommended games they haven't interacted with in the training set.
3.  **Focus on Top-K:** We only care about the top `K` recommendations. In your project, `K=20`. For simplicity in this explanation, let's use **`K=5`**. Let's say the system generated these **Top 5 Recommendations** for User 123:
    `Recommended Items (Top 5) = [Game Y (app_id=250), Game P (app_id=999), Game X (app_id=100), Game Q (app_id=888), Game R (app_id=777)]`

**Calculating the Metrics for User 123 (K=5):**

1.  **Identify the "Hits" (True Positives):**
    *   **What:** Which games in the `Recommended Items (Top 5)` list are *also* present in the `Actual Relevant Items` set?
    *   **Calculation:** Find the intersection:
        *   `Recommended Items (Top 5) =`
        *   `Actual Relevant Items = {100, 250, 500}`
        *   **Intersection (Hits)** = `{250, 100}`
    *   **Number of Hits (True Positives, TP)** = **2**

2.  **Identify False Positives (FP @ K=5):**
    *   **What:** Which games in the `Recommended Items (Top 5)` list are *NOT* present in the `Actual Relevant Items` set? These were recommended but weren't actually relevant according to the test data.
    *   **Calculation:** Items in Top-K recommendations that are *not* hits.
        *   `Recommended Items (Top 5) =`
        *   `Hits = {250, 100}`
        *   **False Positives (FP)** = `{999, 888, 777}` (Games P, Q, R)
    *   **Number of False Positives (FP)** = **3**
    *   *Note:* `TP + FP` always equals `K` (2 + 3 = 5).

3.  **Identify False Negatives (FN @ K=5):**
    *   **What:** Which games in the `Actual Relevant Items` set were *NOT* included in the `Recommended Items (Top 5)` list? These are relevant items the system *failed* to recommend within the top K.
    *   **Calculation:** Items in `Actual Relevant Items` that are *not* hits.
        *   `Actual Relevant Items = {100, 250, 500}`
        *   `Hits = {250, 100}`
        *   **False Negatives (FN)** = `{500}` (Game Z)
    *   **Number of False Negatives (FN)** = **1**
    *   *Note:* `TP + FN` always equals the total number of `Actual Relevant Items` (2 + 1 = 3).

4.  **Calculate Precision@K (Precision@5):**
    *   **Question:** Of the 5 games recommended, what proportion were actually relevant?
    *   **Formula:** `Precision@K = TP / (TP + FP)` or `Number of Hits / K`
    *   **Calculation:** `Precision@5 = 2 / (2 + 3) = 2 / 5 = 0.4`
    *   **Interpretation:** 40% of the top 5 recommendations for user 123 were relevant.

5.  **Calculate Recall@K (Recall@5):**
    *   **Question:** Of the 3 actually relevant games, what proportion did the system successfully recommend in the top 5?
    *   **Formula:** `Recall@K = TP / (TP + FN)` or `Number of Hits / Total Number of Relevant Items`
    *   **Calculation:** `Recall@5 = 2 / (2 + 1) = 2 / 3 â‰ˆ 0.667`
    *   **Interpretation:** The system recalled (found) 66.7% of the relevant items for user 123 within its top 5 suggestions.

**Applying to Your Project (K=20):**

*   The calculations work exactly the same way, but you consider the **Top 20** recommendations (`K=20`).
*   You perform these calculations for **every** user in your `valid_test_user_ids` set (e.g., ~348k users for CF, ~503k for MF, 10k sample for CBF).
*   The final reported metrics (e.g., `Average Precision@20 = 0.0372`, `Average Recall@20 = 0.2359` for the MF Binary Interaction model) are the **average** of the individual Precision@20 and Recall@20 scores calculated for each of those thousands of users.

This averaging gives an overall measure of how well the model performs across the evaluated user base.
